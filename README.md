# RNCCI


REST API Project with ASP.NET Core

This project were developed to help Serviço Nacional de Saúde (SNS) to manage RNCCI, we used REST API and SOAP Services to create the full application.
As client we used Windows Forms, the user is able to register new patients, request and consult vehicles for to specify zone also it's possible to request materials from central of state purchases. last but not least the user have acess to some different dashboard where we can chekc out how many patient each unit has and how many vehicles have been requested in last 30 days.
